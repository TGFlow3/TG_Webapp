High level workflow of an LLM:

1. Training:

The model is fed a massive dataset of text (books, articles, websites, etc.).
It learns language patterns, grammar, facts, and context by adjusting its internal parameters to predict the next word in a sequence.
2. Input/Prompt:

You provide a prompt or question to the trained model.
3. Tokenization:

The input text is broken down into smaller units called tokens (words or subwords).
4. Processing:

The model processes the tokens using its neural network layers, applying attention mechanisms to understand context and relationships.
5. Prediction:

The model predicts the most likely next token(s) based on the input and its learned knowledge.
6. Output Generation:

The model generates a response by stringing together predicted tokens until it reaches a stopping point.
7. Decoding:

The tokens are converted back into human-readable text and returned as the output.
This workflow allows LLMs to generate coherent, context-aware responses to a wide variety of prompts.
